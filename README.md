"Beginner Projects with ATMEGA-16 and LPC2148" 

This repository contains beginner-friendly embedded systems projects developed using ATMEGA16 and LPC2148. These projects are written in C and they cover a range of fundamental concepts like controlling LEDs, serial communication via UART, using interrupts, and displaying data on a seven-segment display.

In addition to the code and documentation, a Media folder is included with photos and videos to provide visual guidance on the project setups and expected results.
